Naming conventions are used to correlate Topaz for Total Test unit test projects to the target programs of the tests:
    - The Git repository uses `<ISPW_Stream_Name>_<ISPW_Application_Name>_Unit_Tests` as name
    - The Topaz for Total Test project name uses `<Target_Program_Name>_Unit_Tests` as project name 
    - The test scenario files or test suite files contain the `<Target_Program_Name>` as first part of their file name, followed by an underscore `_`, follwowed by any trailing name. Topaz for Total Test itself requires the file extensions
        - `.testscenario` for test scenarios
        - `.testsuite` for test suites
    - Due to the design of the underlying application, there are three paths through the development stages. Therefore, there will be three different `STEPLIB` concatenations to use in the Topaz for Total Test `runner.jcl`. The approach taken in the example is to have three different versions of the `runner.jcl` each using a different `STEPLIB` concatenation. The code of the pipeline will determine which `jcl` to use.
        - `Runner_PATH1.jcl` is used for the path from `DEV1` to `PRD`
        - `Runner_PATH2.jcl` is used for the path from `DEV2` to `PRD`
        - `Runner_PATH3.jcl` is used for the path from `DEV3` to `PRD`
